# GitHub Project Board Setup

## Step 1: Authorize GitHub CLI for Projects

Run this command and follow the browser authentication:

```powershell
gh auth refresh -s project,read:project
```

Follow the prompts to authorize the CLI with project permissions.

## Step 2: Create the Project Board

Once authenticated, run:

```powershell
gh project create --owner dollythedog --title "Clinic Chatbot MVP"
```

## Step 3: Link Issues to Project (Web UI)

Unfortunately, the GitHub CLI doesn't yet support adding issues to projects programmatically in a straightforward way. You'll need to do this via the web UI:

1. Go to https://github.com/dollythedog/clinic_cancellation_chatbot/projects
2. Click on your newly created "Clinic Chatbot MVP" project
3. Click "Add items" and select issues #1-#25
4. Organize them into columns:
   - **üìã Backlog** - All Milestone 2-5 issues
   - **üéØ To Do** - Milestone 1 issues (#1-#7)
   - **üèóÔ∏è In Progress** - Currently working on
   - **‚úÖ Done** - Completed issues

## Step 4: Configure Project Settings

In the project settings:
1. Enable **Status** field with values: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done
2. Enable **Priority** field with values: High, Medium, Low
3. Enable **Milestone** field
4. Set up automation rules:
   - When issue is closed ‚Üí Move to Done
   - When issue is assigned ‚Üí Move to In Progress

## Alternative: Use GitHub Web UI Directly

If CLI auth is problematic, you can create the project entirely through the web:

1. Go to https://github.com/dollythedog?tab=projects
2. Click "New project"
3. Choose "Board" template
4. Name it "Clinic Chatbot MVP"
5. Add all 25 issues from the repository
