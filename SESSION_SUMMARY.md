## üìä Progress Overview

### Milestones Status

| Milestone | Status | Issues | Progress |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|
| **1. Bootstrap** | ‚úÖ Complete | #1-7 | 7/7 (100%) |
| 2. Core Logic | üîú To Do | #8-15 | 0/8 (0%) |

**Total Issues:** 25  
**Completed:** 7  
**Overall Progress:** 28%

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack Confirmed

- **Backend:** FastAPI 0.120.4
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 14+ with SQLAlchemy 2.0.23
- **Database Driver:** psycopg 3.2.12 (psycopg3 for Windows compatibility)
- **Messaging:** Twilio 9.8.5
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit 1.51.0
- **Scheduler:** APScheduler 3.11.1
- **Testing:** pytest 8.4.2, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov
- **Code Quality:** black, flake8, isort, mypy
- **Migration Tool:** Alembic 1.17.1

---

## üéì Decisions Made

1. **Architecture:** Confirmed FastAPI + Streamlit (not Flask)
   - FastAPI for backend/webhooks/API
   - Streamlit for internal dashboard
   - Rationale: Better async support, faster UI development

2. **Database Driver:** Switched from psycopg2 to psycopg3
   - Reason: Better Windows compatibility (no C compiler needed)
   - Version: psycopg[binary] 3.2.12

3. **Issue Tracking:** Dual approach
   - Local: `ISSUES.md` for day-to-day work
   - GitHub: Issues + Project board for collaboration and visibility
   - Sync command: `make issues-sync`

4. **Workflow:** Sequential milestone approach
   - Complete one milestone at a time
   - Work through issues in priority order
   - Commit frequently, push at milestone completion

---

## üöß Known Issues / Blockers

**None** - Milestone 1 completed successfully!

Minor notes:
- PowerShell execution policy prevented venv activation (worked around by using global Python)
- Line ending warnings (LF‚ÜíCRLF) on git add (expected on Windows, not a blocker)

---

## üìù Next Session Plan

### Primary Goal: Start Milestone 2 - Core Logic

**High Priority Issues to Tackle:**
1. **Issue #8** - Implement ORM models (models.py)
   - Create SQLAlchemy models for all tables
   - Add relationships and constraints
   
2. **Issue #9** - Build prioritizer.py with scoring algorithm
   - Implement priority calculation logic
   - urgent_flag + manual_boost + days_until_appt + seniority

3. **Issue #10** - Create orchestrator.py
   - Batch message sending logic
   - Hold timer management
   - Offer expiration

4. **Issue #15** - Add race-safe reservation logic
   - SELECT FOR UPDATE implementation
   - Prevent double-booking

**Session Structure:**
1. Review this summary
2. Pick next issue from Milestone 2
3. Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Commit
4. Update `ISSUES.md` and close GitHub issues as completed
5. End with session summary

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Issue tracking pays off:** Having 25 issues organized up-front makes it crystal clear what needs to be done
2. **Kanban is powerful:** Visual workflow helps see the big picture
3. **Sequential execution:** Completing one milestone at a time prevents context switching
4. **Commit frequently:** Small, focused commits make progress trackable
5. **Documentation during, not after:** Creating SESSION_SUMMARY.md while working is easier than reconstructing later
