# Session 3: Critical Fixes & Completion

**Date:** November 1, 2025 (Afternoon)  
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Focus:** Bug fixes and production readiness

## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. SQLAlchemy Enum Handling (⚠️ CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Database queries failing with "invalid input value for enum offer_state: 'PENDING'"
- Root cause: SQLAlchemy using enum `.name` instead of `.value`
- Impact: All offer queries broken, scheduler failing every 30 seconds

**Solution:** Added `values_callable=lambda obj: [e.value for e in obj]` to all enum columns

**Files Fixed:** `app/infra/models.py` (4 enum columns)

### 2. Windows Date Formatting (⚠️ HIGH)
**Problem:** Dashboard crashing with "invalid format string" errors  
- Root cause: `%-I` format not supported on Windows
- Impact: Dashboard unusable, time utilities broken

**Solution:** Replaced all `%-I`, `%-H`, `%-M` with `%I`, `%H`, `%M`

**Files Fixed:**
- `dashboard/app.py` (7 locations)
- `utils/time_utils.py` (2 locations)

### 3. Dashboard Infinite Rerun Loop (⚠️ HIGH)
**Problem:** Dashboard never finished loading
- Root cause: Auto-refresh calling `st.rerun()` immediately
- Impact: Dashboard completely unusable

**Solution:**
- Changed default from `value=True` to `value=False`
- Added `time.sleep(30)` before `st.rerun()`

**Files Fixed:** `dashboard/app.py` (lines 98-101)

## ✨ New Features

### Sample Data Generator
**Created:** `scripts/seed_sample_data.py` (337 lines)

**Generates:**
- 3 providers (MD/DO and APP types)
- 5 patients with varying priority scores
- 2 open cancellations (tomorrow + next week)
- Active offers with hold timers
- Message log entries

**Usage:** `python scripts/seed_sample_data.py`

## 📚 Documentation Updated

- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Marked Milestone 3 complete
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added v0.3.0 release notes
- `ISSUES.md` - Updated progress (18/25 = 72%)
- `README.md` - Added seed instructions and latest status
- `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - This update

## ✅ Verification

**Tested and Confirmed Working:**
- ✅ FastAPI starts without errors
- ✅ Database enum queries work correctly  
- ✅ Dashboard loads successfully
- ✅ All date/time displays render correctly
- ✅ Auto-refresh works with 30-second delay
- ✅ Sample data populates successfully
- ✅ All 4 dashboard views accessible

## 🔜 Next Steps

**Milestone 4: Hardening (Priority)**
1. STOP/HELP keyword handling (#19)
2. Opt-out tracking (#20)
3. Audit logging (#21)
4. Rate limiting (#22)
5. Exception handling improvements

**Status:** Ready to begin Milestone 4

**Total Issues:** 25  
**Completed:** 18  
**Overall Progress:** 72%

---

## 🔧 Technology Confirmed

- **Dashboard:** Streamlit 1.51.0
- **Database ORM:** SQLAlchemy 2.0.23
- **Time Handling:** Python zoneinfo (UTC/Central conversion)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with Streamlit markdown

---

## 🎯 Decisions Made

1. **Dashboard Architecture:** Function-based design
   - Separate functions for each view and card type
   - Better code organization and reusability
   - Easier to test and maintain

2. **Privacy Protection:** Show only last 4 digits of phone
   - HIPAA-conscious design
   - Balances identification with privacy
   - Staff can recognize patients without full PHI

3. **Auto-refresh:** 30-second intervals
   - Real-time enough for monitoring
   - Not too frequent to cause performance issues
   - User can toggle on/off

4. **Expandable Cards:** Top 5 waitlist entries expanded
   - Focuses attention on highest priority patients
   - Reduces visual clutter
   - Easy to expand others as needed

5. **Color Coding:** Traffic light system for offer states
   - 🟡 Yellow = Pending (waiting for response)
   - 🟢 Green = Accepted (success)
   - ⚪ White = Declined (neutral)
   - ⚫ Black = Expired (timed out)
   - 🔴 Red = Failed (error)

---

## 🚧 Known Issues / Blockers

**None** - Milestone 3 completed successfully!

**Notes:**
- Dashboard requires database to be set up and populated
- Will show "empty" states until test data is added
- Auto-refresh uses `st.rerun()` which is Streamlit's recommended approach

---

## 📝 Next Session Plan

**High Priority Issues to Tackle:**
1. **Issue #19** - Implement STOP/HELP keyword handling
   - Parse incoming SMS for keywords
   - STOP: Update opt_out flag
   - HELP: Send auto-response
   
2. **Issue #20** - Add opt-out tracking in database
   - Update PatientContact.opt_out field
   - Filter out opted-out patients from offers
   
3. **Issue #21** - Create audit logging system
   - Log all system actions
   - Track who did what when
   - HIPAA compliance requirement

4. **Issue #22** - Add rate limiting
   - Prevent SMS spam
   - Implement per-hour limits
   - Track message counts

**Also Consider:**

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Streamlit is fast:** Built entire dashboard in 30 minutes
2. **Function decomposition helps:** Separate functions for each component made code readable
3. **Error handling is critical:** Wrapped all DB queries in try/except for robustness
4. **Privacy by default:** Showing last 4 digits only was the right call
5. **Visual feedback matters:** Color coding and icons improve UX significantly

## 🛠️ Technology Stack Confirmed

- **Backend:** FastAPI 0.120.4
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 14+ with SQLAlchemy 2.0.23
- **Database Driver:** psycopg 3.2.12 (psycopg3 for Windows compatibility)
- **Messaging:** Twilio 9.8.5

- **Testing:** pytest 8.4.2, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov
- **Code Quality:** black, flake8, isort, mypy
- **Migration Tool:** Alembic 1.17.1

---

## 🎓 Decisions Made

1. **Architecture:** Confirmed FastAPI + Streamlit (not Flask)
   - FastAPI for backend/webhooks/API
   - Streamlit for internal dashboard
   - Rationale: Better async support, faster UI development

2. **Database Driver:** Switched from psycopg2 to psycopg3
   - Reason: Better Windows compatibility (no C compiler needed)
   - Version: psycopg[binary] 3.2.12

3. **Issue Tracking:** Dual approach
   - Local: `ISSUES.md` for day-to-day work
   - GitHub: Issues + Project board for collaboration and visibility
   - Sync command: `make issues-sync`

4. **Workflow:** Sequential milestone approach
   - Complete one milestone at a time
   - Work through issues in priority order
   - Commit frequently, push at milestone completion

---

## 🚧 Known Issues / Blockers

**None** - Milestone 1 completed successfully!

Minor notes:
- PowerShell execution policy prevented venv activation (worked around by using global Python)
- Line ending warnings (LF→CRLF) on git add (expected on Windows, not a blocker)

---

## 📝 Next Session Plan

### Primary Goal: Start Milestone 2 - Core Logic

**High Priority Issues to Tackle:**
1. **Issue #8** - Implement ORM models (models.py)
   - Create SQLAlchemy models for all tables
   - Add relationships and constraints
   
2. **Issue #9** - Build prioritizer.py with scoring algorithm
   - Implement priority calculation logic
   - urgent_flag + manual_boost + days_until_appt + seniority

3. **Issue #10** - Create orchestrator.py
   - Batch message sending logic
   - Hold timer management
   - Offer expiration

4. **Issue #15** - Add race-safe reservation logic
   - SELECT FOR UPDATE implementation
   - Prevent double-booking

**Session Structure:**
1. Review this summary
2. Pick next issue from Milestone 2
3. Implement → Test → Commit
4. Update `ISSUES.md` and close GitHub issues as completed
5. End with session summary

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Issue tracking pays off:** Having 25 issues organized up-front makes it crystal clear what needs to be done
2. **Kanban is powerful:** Visual workflow helps see the big picture
3. **Sequential execution:** Completing one milestone at a time prevents context switching
4. **Commit frequently:** Small, focused commits make progress trackable
5. **Documentation during, not after:** Creating SESSION_SUMMARY.md while working is easier than reconstructing later
